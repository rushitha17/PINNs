# PINNs
Implementation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks, a deep learning framework that leverages both data and the underlying physical laws to solve complex problems in scientific computing. PINNs is a approach by incorporating known physical principles into the loss function during training, allowing for accurate predictions even with limited data.
